c. How to delete all rows in a table except first row?	  
Ans: // Assuming you have a table with an ID of 'myTable'
$('#myTable tr:gt(0)').remove();

$('#myTable tr:gt(0)'): This selector targets all <tr> elements within the table with the ID myTable that have an index greater than 0. The :gt(0) selector is used to skip the first row (since index in jQuery is zero-based).
